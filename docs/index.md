# Reproducible computational environments using containers

This lesson provides an introduction to using the [Apptainer container platform](https://apptainer.org/). Apptainer is particularly suited to running containers on infrastructure where users donâ€™t have administrative privileges, for example shared infrastructure such as High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.

This lesson will introduce Apptainer from scratch showing you how to run a simple container and building up to creating your own containers and running parallel scientific workloads on HPC infrastructure.
