# 3. Using containers to run commands

!!! circle-question "Overview"

    **Questions**

    - How do I use container software on the cluster?
    - How do I run different commands within a container?
    - How do I access an interactive shell within a container?

    **Objectives**

    - Learn how to run different commands when starting a container.
    - Learn how to open an interactive shell within a container environment.


## Pulling a new image and running a container

Lets continue by pulling a new image from another public image repository and start to work with the container.

!!! terminal "code"
    ```bash
    $ apptainer pull docker://ghcr.io/apptainer/lolcow
    ```

    >```bash
    >INFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format
    >INFO:    Starting build...
    >Getting image source signatures

    >```

We pulled a Docker image from a Docker image repo using the`apptainer pull` command and directed it to store the image file using the default name `lolcow_latest.sif` in the current directory. If you run the `ls` command, you should see that the `lolcow_latest.sif` file is now present in the current directory. This is our image and we can now run a container based on this image:


!!! terminal ""code"

    ```bash
    $ apptainer run lolcow_latest.sif 
    ```
    >```bash

    >                ||----w |
    >                ||     ||
    >```

    - Most images are also directly executable 

    ```bash
    $ ./lolcow_latest.sif
    ```

How did the container determine what to do when we ran it?! What did running the container actually do to result in the displayed output?

When you run a container from a sif image without using any additional command line arguments, the container runs the default run script that is embedded within the image. This is a shell script that can be used to run commands, tools or applications stored within the image on container startup. We can inspect the imageâ€™s run script using the `apptainer inspect` command:

!!! terminal "code"

    ```bash
    $ apptainer inspect -r lolcow_latest.sif | head
    ```
    >```bash
    >#!/bin/sh
    >OCI_ENTRYPOINT='"/bin/sh" "-c" "date | cowsay | lolcat"'
    >OCI_CMD=''
    >
    ># When SINGULARITY_NO_EVAL set, use OCI compatible behavior that does
    ># not evaluate resolved CMD / ENTRYPOINT / ARGS through the shell, and
    ># does not modify expected quoting behavior of args.
    >if [ -n "$SINGULARITY_NO_EVAL" ]; then
    >    # ENTRYPOINT only - run entrypoint plus args
    >    if [ -z "$OCI_CMD" ] && [ -n "$OCI_ENTRYPOINT" ]; then
    >```

    This shows us the first 10 lines of the script within the lolcow_latest.sif image configured to run by default when we use the `apptainer run` command.
