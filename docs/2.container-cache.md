## Apptainer’s image cache and temporary files
Apptainer doesn’t have a local image repository in the same way as Docker, however, it does cache downloaded image files. Apptainer also uses a temporary directory for building images.

By default, Apptainer uses `$HOME/.apptainer` as the location for cache and temporary files. 

You can change the location of the cache by setting environment variables to the cache and temporary directory locations you want to use. Those environment variables are: `APPTAINER_CACHEDIR` & `APPTAINER_TMPDIR`
